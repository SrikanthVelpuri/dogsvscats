# Classification of Dogs and Cats

Download the data from kaggle Dogs vs Cats Competition.

Using Convolutonal Layers we train the model and test the model accuracy on test data.

First used simple layer of 2 convolutional network and got an accuracy of 78%

Next used comlex Convolutional networks and got an accuracy of 92%

Next using Pretrained model VGG16 got an accuracy of 98%

Next using Pretrained model RESNET50 got an accuracy of 98.9%
