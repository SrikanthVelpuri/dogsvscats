# Classification of Dogs and Cats


Using Convolutonal Layers we train the model and test the model accuracy on test data.

First used simple layer of 2 convolutional network and got an accuracy of 78%

Next used 8 Convolutional layers and got an accuracy of 92%

Next using Pretrained model VGG16 got an accuracy of 98%

Next using Pretrained model RESNET50 got an accuracy of 98.9%
